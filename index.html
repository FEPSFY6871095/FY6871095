        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p> Martian exploration requires a propulsion system which can overcome the problems that arise from long-distance travel and extended missions over the years. Nuclear propulsion particularly nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) and nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), offer highly efficient solutions by reducing transit times by being able to carry less fuel onboard. This is important for human mental and physical well-being. This article assesses the principles of this technology, their advantages and whether they are mature enough to be deployed to a manned Mars mission today. It also considers the trade-off between astronaut safety and faster transit times whilst conveying propulsion design and political constraints. Ultimately the article highlights how nuclear propulsion will be pivotal in a human mission to Mars. </p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p> The distance between Mars and Earth varies throughout the year, ranging from 33.9 million miles to 250 million miles. Right now, chemical propulsion systems are prone to overheating and have to carry huge amounts of propellent to slow down when at Mars, whilst carrying around heavy electrical systems to keep the fuel at its operating temperature. Thus, a new approach such as nuclear propulsion should work to address this by eliminating fuel weight issues and increasing efficiency, which work to make travel between Earth and Mars more achievable. </p>

        <h2 id="nuclear-propulsion">What is Nuclear Propulsion?</h2>
        <p> Nuclear propulsion systems make use of nuclear reactions to generate thrust, which is advantageous to chemical propulsion in terms of weight reduction and efficiency. These systems capitalise on the immense energy released by splitting atomic nuclei (nuclear fission), which provides a far greater energy density compared to chemical reactions. This increased energy density translates into better fuel efficiency and enhanced capability for long-duration missions. This provides twice the fuel efficiency of chemical systems (Howe et al., 2015). Increased efficiency is important as it allows for larger payloads to Mars or faster transit times as more fuel can be spent in the acceleration and deceleration of the spacecraft. NEP systems are used to convert heat from a nuclear reaction to electricity which can be used to power an electric ion engine used in satellites today and in the past. The thrust produced is slow and low when compared to chemical systems, but NEP systems can work for weeks on end which allows for speed to compound over time showcasing exceptional efficiency (Buden, 2011). NTP systems work using a  nuclear reactor to heat a propellant, usually liquid hydrogen, to extreme temperatures. The heated propellant is then released through a nozzle, producing thrust. The reactor serves as a heat source, sending energy straight to the propellant without requiring combustion, improving the efficiency. This technique enables NTP systems to produce nearly double the specific impulse—a measure of propulsion efficiency—than chemical rockets (Howe et al., 2015). In addition to shortening travel time, this efficiency allows spacecraft to carry larger payloads, making NTP useful for crewed missions requiring equipment and life support systems. The two systems differ fundamentally from one another mostly in their operational aspects. NTP is preferred for missions that need to transit quickly, including crewed missions to Mars, where it's crucial to cut down on travel time. NEP is more useful for cargo or research missions, where longer operational timeframes are allowed due to its excellent fuel efficiency and modest thrust capability. However, these technologies show innovative development in propulsion, greatly improving on conventional chemical systems and opening the future of interplanetary travel. Both exhibit benefits in efficiency and can be used depending on mission objectives. </p>

        <h2 id="importance">Why Nuclear Propulsion Matters</h2>
        <p> Nuclear propulsion systems offer a lot of benefits compared to using chemical propulsion systems, the most critical being the reduction in transit time. Currently, NTP systems are projected to shorten journey times from 7 months to approximately 4 months (Seedhouse, 2020). This reduction in journey time helps to mitigate the risk posed by ionising radiation from deep space exploration. Prolonged exposure to this radiation can lead to severe health consequences, including cancer and neurological damage. Faster transit enabled by nuclear propulsion minimises the duration of this exposure, thereby enhancing crew safety (Parker et al., 2018). Thus, nuclear propulsion works to decrease overall transit times, therefore improving overall mission safety. Furthermore, faster transit times mean that fewer resources such as food, water and life support systems would need to be taken on a mission. This allows for more exploration-related cargo such as rovers and science equipment to be taken instead of fuel for a chemical system (Howell, 2023). Nuclear propulsion efficiency supports larger missions such as the transportation of large habitations and infrastructure on the Martian surface for longer-term exploration. </p>

        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Risks</h2>
        <p> Despite its advantages nuclear propulsion systems are still encountering developmental issues which need to be addressed before human flight is safe. One of the main concerns is keeping the nuclear propulsion lightweight and compact, whilst being reliable. Advances in material science are important to designing reactors that can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations while maintaining operational efficiency (Seedhouse, 2020). In addition to this, the launch to take the engine into space poses a significant risk to surrounding areas due to the risk of a nuclear blast occurring from the malfunction of the launch rocket. To address these concerns, containment systems and stringent safety protocols are essential (Wall, 2023). To lower these risks, containment systems and stringent safety protocols must be implemented (Larson & Wertz, 2005). Additionally, once in space, managing the reactor in the nuclear propulsion engine requires precise engineering to prevent overheating or other malfunctions that could compromise the mission. In addition to technical difficulties, there are political and legislative barriers to using nuclear propulsion in space travel. To prevent their misuse or weaponisation, international accords, like the Outer Space Treaty, place stringent restrictions on the use of nuclear technologies in space. Close international cooperation in the creation and application of nuclear propulsion systems is necessary for compliance with these frameworks. Public perception of nuclear technologies, which is frequently motivated by worries about safety and environmental hazards, can also affect policy choices and slow advancement. For example, the spectre of a launch failure involving radioactive materials may provoke strong resistance from advocacy groups and local communities near launch sites (Parker et al., 2018). </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p> Nuclear propulsion projects a transformative technology for enabling safe human transit to Mars without the prolonged exposure of 7 months of deep space travel with the use of chemical systems. These innovations provide not only faster and safer travel but also enhance mission feasibility by allowing larger payloads, which are vital for extended stays on Mars and the establishment of infrastructure for future exploration. </p>
